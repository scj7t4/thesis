  abstract = {We present a powerful approach towards full understanding of laser
	light propagation through multimode optical fibres and control of
	the light at the fibre output. Transmission of light within a multimode
	fibre introduces randomization of laser beam amplitude, phase and
	polarization. We discuss the importance of each of these factors
	and introduce an experimental geometry allowing full analysis of
	the light transmission through the multimode fibre and subsequent
	beam-shaping using a single spatial light modulator. We show that
	using this approach one can generate an arbitrary output optical
	field within the accessible field of view and range of spatial frequencies
	given by fibre core diameter and numerical aperture, respectively,
	that contains over 80\% of the total available power. We also show
	that this technology has applications in biophotonics. As an example,
	we demonstrate the manipulation of colloidal microparticles.},

  journal = {Europhys. Lett.},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {75},
  pages = {562--568},
  abstract = {Anderson localisation predicts a phase transition in transport, where
	the diffuse spread of particles comes to a halt with the introduction
	of a critical amount of disorder. This is due to constructive interference
	on closed multiple scattering loops which leads to a renormalisation
	of the diffusion coefficient. This can be described by a slowing-down
	of diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient decreases with time
	according to a power law with an exponent a. In the case of strong
	localisation, where diffusion completely breaks down, the exponent
	is given by a = 1. This is due to the fact that such a dependence
	of the diffusion coefficient naturally leads to a limited spread
	of the diffusing particle even at infinite times. In the critical
	regime approaching the transition, a value of a = 1/3 has been predicted,
	which corresponds to a rescaling of the diffusion coefficient due
	to the presence of closed loops. Using time-resolved measurements
	of photon transport in very turbid media, we have determined these
	scaling exponents experimentally. We find good agreement with theory
	and determine the critical value of the disorder parameter kl* to
	be 4.2(2). Furthermore, we study the critical exponent of the divergence
	of the localisation length at the transition, where we find n = 1/2,
	consistent with the expectation for the exponent of an order parameter.},

	It allows one to calculate speckle pattern correlations in space,
	as well as their sensitivity to external parameters. This method,
	which is similar to the Boltzmann-Langevin approach for the calculation
	of classical fluctuations, applies for a wide range of systems: From
	cases where the ray propagation is diffusive to the regime where
	the rays experience only small angle scattering. The latter case
	comprises the regime of directed waves where rays propagate ballistically
	in space while their directions diffuse. We demonstrate the applicability
	of the method by calculating the correlation function of the wave
	intensity and its sensitivity to the wave frequency and the angle
	of incidence of the incoming wave.},

	in many areas of physics and engineering, including coherent electron-photon

	chips, nonlinear optics and quantum information processing. Critical
	for these applications is the realization of a cavity with both high
	quality factor, Q, and small modal volume, V. The ratio Q/V determines
	the strength of the various cavity interactions, and an ultra-small
	cavity enables large-scale integration and single-mode operation
	for a broad range of wavelengths. However, a high-Q cavity of optical
	wavelength size is difficult to fabricate, as radiation loss increases
	in inverse proportion to cavity size. With the exception of a few

	Various holographic optimization techniques using spatial light modulators
	have recently been explored for adaptive channel impulse response
	improvement of MMF links. Most of these experiments are algorithmic-oriented.
	In this paper, a set of lenses and a spatial light modulator, acting
	as a binary amplitude filter, played the pivotal role in generating
	the input modal electric field into a graded-index MMF, rather than
	algorithms. By using a priori theoretical information to generate
	the incident modal electric field at the MMF, the bandwidth was increased
	by up to 3.4 times.},

	Green's function (NEGF) approach, which provides a powerful conceptual
	tool and a practical analysis method to treat small electronic devices
	quantum mechanically and atomistically. We first review the basis
	for the traditional, semiclassical description of carriers that has
	served device engineers for more than 50 years. We then describe
	why this traditional approach loses validity at the nanoscale. Next,
	we describe semiclassical ballistic transport and the Landauer-Buttiker
	approach to phase coherent quantum transport. Realistic devices include
	interactions that break quantum mechanical phase and also cause energy
	relaxation. As a result, transport in nanodevices are between diffusive
	and phase coherent. We introduce the non equilbrium Green's function
	(NEGF) approach, which can be used to model devices all the way from
	ballistic to diffusive limits. This is followed by a summary of equations
	that are used to model a large class of layered structures such as
	nanotransistors, carbon nanotubes and nanowires. An application of
	the NEGF method in the ballistic and scattering limits to silicon
	nanotransistors is discussed. },

	also determines essential characteristics of the lasing modes such
	as wavelength, emission pattern, directivity, and polarization. In
	random lasers, which do not have mirrors or a well-defined cavity,
	light is confined within the gain medium by means of multiple scattering.
	The sharp peaks in the emission spectra of semiconductor powders,
	first observed in 1999, has therefore lead to an intense debate about
	the nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant
	feedback. We review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at clarifying
	the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with
	gain. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of the idea that
	even the low-Q resonances of such open systems could play a role
	similar to the cavity modes of a conventional laser and produce sharp
	lasing peaks. We focus here on the near-threshold single-mode lasing
	regime where nonlinear effects associated with gain saturation and
	mode competition can be neglected. We discuss in particular the link
	between random laser modes near threshold and the resonances or quasi-bound
	(QB) states of the passive system without gain. For random lasers
	in the localized (strong scattering) regime, QB states and threshold
	lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering
	medium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy
	systems such as random systems in the diffusive regime, where it
	was observed that increasing the openness of such systems eventually
	resulted in measurable and increasing differences between quasi-bound
	states and lasing modes. Very recently, a theory able to treat lasers
	with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random lasers
	established that the threshold lasing modes are in fact distinct
	from QB states of the passive system and are better described in
	terms of a new class of states, the so-called constant-flux states.
	The correspondence between QB states and lasing modes is found to
	improve in the strong scattering limit, confirming the validity of
	initial work in the strong scattering limit.},

	For weakly scattering layers, we have developed an effective analytical
	approach and have calculated the transmission length within a wide
	range of the input parameters. This enables us to describe, in a
	unified way, the localized and ballistic regimes as well as the crossover

	corresponding infinite stack. In both the ballistic regime of a mixed
	stack and in the near long-wave region of a homogeneous stack, the
	transmission length of a realization is a strongly fluctuating quantity.
	In the far long-wave part of the ballistic region, the homogeneous
	stack becomes effectively uniform and the transmission length fluctuations
	are weaker. The crossover region from the localization to the ballistic

	In mixed stacks with only refractive-index disorder, Anderson localization
	at long wavelengths is substantially suppressed, with the localization
	length growing with wavelength much faster than for homogeneous stacks.
	The crossover region becomes essentially wider and transmission resonances
	appear only in much longer stacks. The effects of absorption on one-dimensional
	transport and localization have also been studied, both analytically

	In particular, the stop bands (localized modes) may give rise to
	unusual (strong normal) dispersion in the gaps, yielding fast (slow)
	group velocities above (below) the velocity of light. (ii) There

	This paper is intended to provide more insight into the role of quenched
	disorder on superdiffusive transport in two-dimensional random media.
	The systems under consideration are disordered materials called Levy
	glasses that exhibit large spatial fluctuations in the density of

	show that, by changing sample parameters, quenching effects can be
	increased intentionally, thereby making it possible to investigate
	systematically diverse regimes of transport. In particular, we find
	that strong quenching induces local trapping effects which slow down

	for light waves3, 4, 5, 6, 7, microwaves8, 9, sound waves10 and electron
	gases11. However, there has been no direct observation of exponential
	spatial localization of matter waves of any type. Here we observe
	exponential localization of a Bose-Einstein condensate released into
	a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of a controlled disorder
	created by laser speckle12. We operate in a regime of pure Anderson
	localization, that is, with weak disorder--such that localization
	results from many quantum reflections of low amplitude--and an atomic
	density low enough to render interactions negligible. We directly
	image the atomic density profiles as a function of time, and find
	that weak disorder can stop the expansion and lead to the formation
	of a stationary, exponentially localized wavefunction--a direct signature
	of Anderson localization. We extract the localization length by fitting
	the exponential wings of the profiles, and compare it to theoretical
	calculations. The power spectrum of the one-dimensional speckle potentials
	has a high spatial frequency cutoff, causing exponential localization
	to occur only when the de Broglie wavelengths of the atoms in the
	expanding condensate are greater than an effective mobility edge
	corresponding to that cutoff. In the opposite case, we find that
	the density profiles decay algebraically, as predicted in ref. 13.
	The method presented here can be extended to localization of atomic
	quantum gases in higher dimensions, and with controlled interactions.},

	can lead to the stopping of the expansion and to the formation of
	a stationary exponentially localized wave function, a direct signature
	of AL. Fitting the exponential wings, we extract the localization
	length, and compare it to theoretical calculations. Moreover we show
	that, in our one-dimensional speckle potentials whose noise spectrum
	has a high spatial frequency cut-off, exponential localization occurs
	only when the de Broglie wavelengths of the atoms in the expanding
	BEC are larger than an effective mobility edge corresponding to that
	cut-off. In the opposite case, we find that the density profiles
	decay algebraically, as predicted in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 210401

	of atomic quantum gases in higher dimensions, and with controlled

  abstract = {The realization that electron localization in disordered systems1
	(Anderson localization) is ultimately a wave phenomenon has led to
	the suggestion that photons could be similarly localized by disorder.
	This conjecture attracted wide interest because the differences between
	photons and electrons in their interactions, spin statistics, and
	methods of injection and detection may open a new realm of optical
	and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study of the Anderson
	localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction. To
	date, claims of three-dimensional photon localization have been based
	on observations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave
	as it propagates through the disordered medium. But these reports
	have come under close scrutiny because of the possibility that the
	decay observed may be due to residual absorption and because absorption
	itself may suppress localization. Here we show that the extent of
	photon localization can be determined by a different approach measurement
	of the relative size of fluctuations of certain transmission quantities.
	The variance of relative fluctuations accurately reflects the extent
	of localization, even in the presence of absorption. Using this approach,
	we demonstrate photon localization in both weakly and strongly scattering
	quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in periodic metallic
	wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it out in

	et al., I would like to point out several facts. Aspects of propagation
	of waves through random media are at the heart of mesoscopic physics,
	and have therefore been studied extensively in the last two decades.
	The fact that the transmission matrix (TM) of disordered media depends
	in a complicated, seemingly random manner on the properties of the
	input field has been known for a long time. The use of random media
	as traditional optical components or systems was suggested twenty
	years ago by Isaac Freund [2] and a broader discussion of these proposals
	can also be found in a review by van Rossum and Nieuwenhuizen [3].
	Since then, there have been several developments that exploit the
	existence of the transmission matrix without explicitly knowing it,
	as well as a number of practical applications that rely on measuring
	the transmission matrices of random media. However, the present essay
	does not provide an inclusive perspective of the entire field. The
	Viewpoint by van Putten and Mosk fails to acknowledge the original
	proposal by Freund in 1990 and other experimental demonstrations
	of the use of multiple scattering media as high-precision optical
	instruments. The control and use of light propagating through random
	media is indeed a topic of both significant fundamental importance
	and high practical relevance and, therefore, deserves to be placed
	in the appropriate factual context.},

	between diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements and is shown to

	and analytical calculations in one dimension indicate that transport
	is superdiffusive, with the mean-square displacement growing in time
	as t3/2, regardless of the magnitude of the disorder. Transport is
	shown to arise in this model from a set of measure-zero unscattered
	states at a particular energy in the parent-ordered band. It is argued
	that, when the Fermi level coincides with the energy of the unscattered
	states, an enhancement of transport should obtain. In addition, it
	is shown that superdiffusive motion persists for a wide range of
	correlations between the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements

	distribution. The relevance of these results to transport experiments

	The coherent laser feedback, which has been demonstrated experimentally

	these quasimodes has remained controversial. We develop an analytical

	the length of the trajectories of partial waves traversing the sample,
	which are superposed to create the scattered field. A robust determination
	of localization in the presence of absorption is found, however,
	in steady-state measurements of the statistics of radiation transmitted
	through random samples. This is captured in a single parameter, the
	variance of the total transmission normalized to its ensemble average
	value, which is equal to the degree of intensity correlation of the
	transmitted wave, ?. The intertwined effects of localization and
	absorption can also be disentangled in the time domain since all
	waves emerging from the sample at a fixed time delay from an exciting
	pulse, t , are suppressed equally by absorption. As a result, the
	relative weights of partial waves emerging from the sample, and hence
	the statistics of intensity fluctuations and correlation, and the
	suppression of propagation by weak localization are not changed by
	absorption, and manifest the growing impact of weak localization

	on the other hand, the input distribution for one-dimensional systems

	The scaling equation for probability distributions and for their

  abstract = {'Mesoscopic physics' refers to the physics of structures larger than
	a nanometer (one billionth of a meter) but smaller than a micrometer
	(one millionth of a meter). This size range is the stage on which
	the exciting new research on submicroscopic and electronic and mechanical
	devices is being done. This research often crosses the boundary between
	physics and engineering, since engineering such tiny electronic components
	requires a firm grasp of quantum physics. Applications for the future
	may include such wonders as microscopic robot surgeons that travel
	through the blood stream to repair clogged arteries, submicroscopic
	actuators and builders, and supercomputers that fit on the head of
	a pin. The world of the future is being planned and built by physicists,
	engineers, and chemists working in the microscopic realm. This book
	can be used as the main text in a course on mesoscopic physics or
	as a supplementary text in electronic devices, semiconductor devices,
	and condensed matter physics courses.},

	utilizing all four available DOF, the two field quadratures in the
	two polarizations. Dual-polarization homodyne or heterodyne downconversion
	are linear processes that can fully recover the received signal field
	in these four DOF. When downconverted signals are sampled at the
	Nyquist rate, compensation of transmission impairments can be performed
	using digital signal processing (DSP). Linear impairments, including
	chromatic dispersion and polarization-mode dispersion, can be compensated
	quasi-exactly using finite impulse response filters. Some nonlinear
	impairments, such as intra-channel four-wave mixing and nonlinear
	phase noise, can be compensated partially. Carrier phase recovery
	can be performed using feedforward methods, even when phase-locked
	loops may fail due to delay constraints. DSP-based compensation enables
	a receiver to adapt to time-varying impairments, and facilitates
	use of advanced forward-error-correction codes. We discuss both single-
	and multi-carrier system implementations. For a given modulation
	format, using coherent detection, they offer fundamentally the same
	spectral efficiency and power efficiency, but may differ in practice,
	because of different impairments and implementation details. With
	anticipated advances in analog-to-digital converters and integrated

	so-called paint-on laser systems are extraordinary because they are
	highly disordered systems. The microscopic mechanism for laser activity

	physically reasonable estimates for the absorption and emission cross

	l, the dye concentration ?, and the pump intensity characteristics.
	Our model recaptures the collapse of the emission linewidth at a

	intensity varies with l. In addition, our model predicts a dramatic
	increase in the peak intensity and a further lowering of the lasing
	threshold for the strong scattering limit This suggests a striking
	enhancement of the characteristics of laser paint near the photon

	structure designed to influence the behaviour of photons in much
	the same way that the crystal structure of a semiconductor affects
	the properties of electrons. In particular, photonic crystals forbid
	propagation of photons having a certain range of energies (known
	as a photonic bandgap), a property that could be incorporated in
	the design of novel optoelectronic devices. Following the demonstration
	of a material with a full photonic bandgap at microwave frequencies,
	there has been considerable progress in the fabrication of three-dimensional
	photonic crystals with operational wavelengths as short as 1.5 um
	(ref. 4), although the optical properties of such structures are
	still far from ideal. Here we show that, by restricting the geometry
	of the photonic crystal to two dimensions (in a waveguide configuration),
	structures with polarization-sensitive photonic band-gaps at still
	lower wavelengths (in the range 800-900 nm) can be readily fabricated.
	Our approach should permit the straightforward integration of photonic-
	bandgap structures with other optical and optoelectronic devices.},

	the expansion in terms of (localized) Wannier states which was derived
	earlier by Kroha, Kopp and Walfle. No adjustable parameters enter

	of localization in 3 dimensions for various types of disorder distributions.
	The validity of a universal scaling function of the length dependent
	conductance derived from this theory is discussed in the strong coupling

	of finite systems demonstrates that the self-consistent treatment
	of cooperon contributions is sufficient to explain the phase diagram

	and Zhang [Phys. Rev. B 66 73101, 2002] that allows separating the
	physical solutions of the time-independent Maxwell equations from
	the unphysical ones and describing critical size L c of a random
	system in statistical terms. We found that the dependence of the
	critical gain isin Prime c (at which the lasing threshold occurs)
	as a function of number of layers is configuration-dependent and
	thus the lasing condition for random media is described by means
	of the probability of finding of physical solutions and evaluated
	by averaging over the ensemble of random configurations. By employing
	this approach we inspect the validity of the two-parameter scaling
	model by Zhang [Phys. Rev. B 52 7960, 1995], according to which the
	behavior of the random system with gain is described by relation
	1/xgr = 1/xgr 0 + 1/l g, where xgr and xgr 0 are localization length
	with and without gain, respectively, and l g = 2/ohgrisin Prime,

	constant that represents gain. We show that the range of validity
	of this relation depends on the ratio of both lengths and also affects
	the slope of the ln Lambdac(q) (where Lambdac equiv L c/xgr 0 is
	normalized critical size and q -1 equiv l g/xgr 0 is dimensionless
	gain length). We extend the study of the relation for the critical
	size L c by inspecting the dependence of the slope of the ln Lambdac(q)
	on the strength of the randomness. We interpret its behavior in terms
	of the statistical properties of the localized states. Namely, by
	studying of the variance of the Lyapunov exponent lambda (the inverse
	of the localization length xgr 0) we have found that the slope of
	the ln Lambdac(q)) reflects the transition between two different
	regimes of localization with Anderson and Lifshits-like behavior
	that is known to be indicated by peak in var(lambda). We discuss
	the generalization of two-parameter scaling model by implementing
	revisited single parameter scaling (SPS) theory by Deych et al. [Phys.

	(where the radiative degrees of freedom have been eliminated and
	providing one essentially with atomic physics). In addition the polariton
	approach is discussed, in which the degrees of freedom of light and

	the equivalence of the three methods. Much of the presented material

	mechanism is confirmed by the approximated transfer matrix method,
	in which only the relevant interfaces are considered. Then we find
	that the edges of the traditional gaps can be obtained from the condition
	x2 =2, where x2 is the second order trace map. Around the basic traditional
	gap, there are two finite spectral regions in which the transmission
	spectra look like the bands of a periodic system and the eigenstates
	behave like the Bloch states, so that they are defined as the traditional
	bands. Simultaneously, it is numerically illuminated that the traditional
	bands are well defined physically. Finally, the localization properties
	of the fractal gap-edge state are studied by the quality factor Q.
	The result indicates the fractal gap-edge states become hyperexponentially

	thick samples, far into the limit of strong multiple scattering;

	several reasons. Here, we correct for two of these defects. By modeling

	for the fact that photons usually scatter anisotropically into the

	with random walk computer simulations and with experiments on specially

	and correlations of energy levels and eigenfunction amplitudes in
	diffusive mesoscopic samples. Various spatial geometries are considered,
	with emphasis on low-dimensional (quasi-1D and 2D) systems. Calculations
	are based on the supermatrix sigma-model approach. The method reproduces,
	in so-called zero-mode approximation, the universal random matrix
	theory (RMT) results for the energy-level and eigenfunction fluctuations.
	Going beyond this approximation allows us to study system-specific
	deviations from universality, which are determined by the diffusive
	classical dynamics in the system. These deviations are especially
	strong in the far ``tails'' of the distribution function of the eigenfunction
	amplitudes (as well as of some related quantities, such as local
	density of states, relaxation time, etc.). These asymptotic ``tails''
	are governed by anomalously localized states which are formed in
	rare realizations of the random potential. The deviations of the
	level and eigenfunction statistics from their RMT form strengthen
	with increasing disorder and become especially pronounced at the
	Anderson metal-insulator transition. In this regime, the wave functions
	are multifractal, while the level statistics acquires a scale-independent
	form with distinct critical features. Fluctuations of the conductance
	and of the local intensity of a classical wave radiated by a point-like
	source in the quasi-1D geometry are also studied within the sigma-model
	approach. For a ballistic system with rough surface an appropriately
	modified (``ballistic'') sigma-model is used. Finally, the interplay
	of the fluctuations and the electron-electron interaction in small
	samples is discussed, with application to the Coulomb blockade spectra.

	sums of broadly distributed variables (as a consequence of the presence
	of on-site random energies in the denominators of the perturbation

	even in the positive region $f>0$, and vanish at different values
	$\alpha_+^{typ} > \alpha_+^{av}$, in contrast to the standard picture.

The method is based on a selfconsistent solution of the equation for the self energy in second order perturbation theory, whose solution may be purely real almost everywhere (localized states) or complex everywhere (nonlocalized states). The equations used are exact for a Bethe lattice. The selfconsistency condition gives a nonlinear integral equation in two variables for the probability distribution of the real and imaginary parts of the self energy. A simple approximation for the stability limit of localized states gives Anderson's 'upper limit approximation'. Exact solution of the stability problem in a special case gives results very close to Anderson's best estimate.}

	a complex effective wave vector. Its negative imaginary part causes
	an exponential decay of the transmission coefficient due to a distributed
	quasitotal reflection. Its real part is independent of frequency,
	so that the phase time becomes independent of the system size. This
	time alternates between two distinct values and approximately equals
	the Buttiker-Landauer tunneling time. Superluminal group velocities
	are obtained for the propagation of narrow frequency band wave packets.
	The effective complex wave vector results from multiple reflections
	of oscillating propagating waves. For both the plane wave and the
	waveguide dispersion the most ordered structures exhibit the most
	effective coherent interference and thus the deepest gaps in the
	transmission spectra as well as the smallest decay length. The Thue-Morse
	sequence is less ordered than the Fibonacci one, which in turn is
	less ordered than the periodic system. Increasing disorder enhances
	the phase time, the Buttiker-Landauer time, and the density of states
	in the gap regions. The group velocity becomes smaller, but still
	remains superluminal. The spectra of lambda/4 systems are similar
	for both the plane-wave and the waveguide dispersion. The Fibonacci
	scaling relation has been checked. It holds for a periodicity of
	6, whereas the claimed periodicity of 3 has found to be not valid

	the properties of photonic and phononic (sonic) heterostructures.
	The most beneficial feature of quasiperiodicity is that it can combine
	perfectly ordered structures with purely point-diffractive spectra
	of arbitrarily high rotational symmetry. Both are prerequisites for
	the construction of isotropic band gap composites, in particular
	from materials with low index contrast, which are required for numerous
	applications. Another interesting property of quasiperiodic structures
	is their scaling symmetry, which may be exploited to create spectral

  abstract = {The mechanisms of photon propagation in random media in the diffusive
	multiple scattering regime have been previously studied using diffusion
	approximation. However, similar understanding in the low-order (subdiffusion)
	scattering regime is not complete due to difficulties in tracking
	photons that undergo very few scatterings events. Recent developments
	in low-coherence enhanced backscattering (LEBS) overcome these difficulties
	and enable probing photons that travel very short distances and undergo
	only a few scattering events. In LEBS, enhanced backscattering is
	observed under illumination with spatial coherence length Lsc less
	than the scattering mean free path ls. In order to understand the
	mechanisms of photon propagation in LEBS in the subdiffusion regime,
	it is imperative to develop analytical and numerical models that
	describe the statistical properties of photon trajectories. Here
	we derive the probability distribution of penetration depth of LEBS
	photons and report Monte Carlo numerical simulations to support our
	analytical results. Our results demonstrate that, surprisingly, the
	transport of photons that undergo low-order scattering events has
	only weak dependence on the optical properties of the medium (ls
	and anisotropy factor g) and strong dependence on the spatial coherence
	length of illumination, Lsc relative to those in the diffusion regime.
	More importantly, these low-order scattering photons typically penetrate
	less than ls into the medium due to the low spatial coherence length
	of illumination and their penetration depth is proportional to the
	one-third power of the coherence volume},

	N-period layered systems is formulated in terms of tangents only.
	The resulting equations are compact, algorithmically simple, numerically
	stable, and physically appealing. The derived secular equation is

	conditions and analytic wave functions for the three layer problem.
	The analyticity of the formalism should aid the band-gap engineering

	(evolution) equations for the transfer and scattering matrices and
	Landauer's formula. In this work, we apply the method to the quasi-one-dimensional
	limit and provide a systematic treatment of all the transport regimes
	present. In the ballistic regime, we consider the transition between
	the Sharvin and Drude conductances and recover many exact results
	of the classic transport theory. In the weak localization (diffusive)
	regime, the bulk of the probability distribution of the conductance
	of a wire is shown to be normal Gaussian, in agreement with the predictions
	based on the nonlinear ? model. The formalism developed provides
	a convenient way of calculating the quantum-interference effects
	not only in the conductance but in arbitrary linear statistics on
	the transmission eigenvalues as well. In the classic diffusive limit,
	the eigenvalue density is independent on the geometry of the conductor.
	In the strong localization regime, the distribution of the conductance
	is found to coincide with Abrikosov's solution (approximately log
	normal), describing a purely one-dimensional chain. The calculated
	value of the localization length is proportional to the cross section
	of the wire, in precise agreement with Efetov's result obtained with
	the use of supersymmetric techniques. We recover the theory of the
	coherent backscattering peak and calculate the enhancement factor.
	The angular structure of the transmission and reflection coefficients
	is calculated exactly and found to be nonisotropic, which is contrary
	to the standard isotropy assumption of the existing macroscopic models.
	The approach is shown to provide microscopical proof of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar
	equation for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues within
	the realistic model of a wire with the isotropic dispersion law.},

	a two-dimensional Anderson disordered medium is integrated over times
	of the order of 27 000 inverse bandwidths. Excitations by narrow
	band sources lead to wave energy densities whose ensemble averages
	behave diffusively at early times. The behavior at more general times
	and distances is, however, not diffusive. The observed transport
	profiles are shown to be inconsistent with predictions from a simple
	hydrodynamical continuum model of Anderson localization, and to the
	hypothesis of exponentially slow diffusion. The evolution of the
	energy density distribution in systems with varying disorders and
	microstructures, and over a range of length scales, is found to collapse
	to a single function of rescaled space and time well approximated
	by e(x,t))p with n 0.46, p 0.76, where x is the distance from the
	source, is the localization length, and the is a ``residual diffusivity''

	distribution of the level spacings and widths. The question then
	comes up naturally, whether the distribution law for width and
	spacing is different for protons, neutrons, etc., i.e. whether it

	It is pointed out that while the average width must depend on the

  abstract = {We explore the interplay between generic and mesoscopic aspects of
	speckle patterns appearing in a single polarization component of
	the transmitted field of multiply scattering media. The crucial role
	of phase singularities in speckle patterns of diffusing and localized
	microwave radiation in quasi-one-dimensional samples is demonstrated
	in the dynamics of local transmission, in the statistics of structural
	features within the speckle pattern and in the motion of singularities
	as the frequency is scanned. We also describe a crossover between
	one- and three-dimensional propagation in random layered media with
	transverse disorder associated with an optical delocalization transition.
	The transition occurs at the thickness beyond which singularities
	are formed in the transmitted speckle pattern as the transverse spread
	of the wave becomes larger than the field correlation length. These
	studies demonstrate the relationship between field structures within
	individual Gaussian speckle patterns and non-ergodic statistics of
	local and integrated transmission for diffusive and localized waves
	in ensembles of random samples.},

	approaches, each appropriate in a specific time range: (i) diffusion

	diffusion coefficient in space and frequency, D(z,Omega); (iii) a
	dynamic single parameter scaling (DSPS) model, which reflects the
	decay of localized modes which do not overlap in space and frequency;
	and (iv) simulations of 1D random media. For times up to twice the
	diffusion time tauD, diffusion theory gives an excellent fit to the
	data. For times up to 4tauD, the slowing of the decay rate of transmission
	is in accord with SCLT. For longer times, transmission decays more
	slowly than the predictions of the SCLT, indicating the inability
	of this modified diffusion theory to capture the decay of long-lived
	localized states. Beyond the Heisenberg time, the decay rate approaches
	the predictions of the DSPS model, reflecting the increasing proportion
	of wave energy in long-lived localized states. The decay rates obtained
	from 1D simulations are then in good agreement with measurements
	in quasi-1D samples and coincide with decay rates given by the DSPS

	photonic bandgaps, whereby multiple scattering of photons by lattices
	of periodically varying refractive indices acts to prevent the propagation
	of electromagnetic waves having certain wavelengths. One route to
	forming photonic crystals is to etch two-dimensional periodic lattices
	of vertical air holes into dielectric slab waveguides. Such structures
	can show complete photonic bandgaps, but only for large-diameter
	air holes in materials of high refractive index (such as gallium
	arsenide, n = 3.69), which unfortunately leads to significantly reduced
	optical transmission when combined with optical fibres of low refractive
	index. It has been suggested that quasicrystalline (rather than periodic)
	lattices can also possess photonic bandgaps. Here we demonstrate
	this concept experimentally and show that it enables complete photonic
	bandgaps - non-directional and for any polarization - to be realized
	with small air holes in silicon nitride (n = 2.02), and even glass
	(n = 1.45). These properties make photonic quasicrystals promising
