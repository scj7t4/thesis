  abstract = {Advanced persistent threats (APTs) pose a daunting security challenge
	for todays cyber-security professionals. No longer relegated to
	state-sponsored attacks, APTs are now reaching into all levels of
	the commercial sector. In fact, the largest growth area for targeted
	attacks in 2012 was businesses with fewer than 250 employees. In
	a recent survey of 1500 cyber-security professionals, ISACA found
	that 94 percent believe that APTs are a serious threat and 63% think
	it is only a matter of time before they experience an APT attack.
	
	During this presentation, Pat Clawson, Chairman and CEO of leading
	security software vendor Lumension, will discuss how a defense-in-depth
	approach to endpoint security can give organizations back the upper
	hand against APTs. He will cover a range of topics including:
	
	 Understanding the nature of todays cyber-security threat  Critical
	factors organizations need to be aware of to defend themselves from
	APTs  Why the traditional methods of endpoint security cant stop
	these advanced threats
	
	 Pragmatic steps that every organization should take to reduce their
	APT risk without negatively impacting their productivity},

	distinct and completely separate worlds: us and them. This partition
	is absolute and complete. More complex situations are most commonly
	treated as sets of increasingly more secure domains. This view is
	too simplistic for cyber-physical systems. Absolute divisions are
	conceptually clean, but they do not reflect the real world. Security
	partitions often overlap, frequently provide for the high level to
	have complete access to the low level, and are more complex than
	an impervious wall. We present a model that handles situations where
	the security domains are complex or the threat space is ill defined.
	To demonstrate our method, we examine a drive by wire system from
	both the traditional view and in light of the modern reality. This
	paper examines the system from the viewpoint of the driver with special
	emphasis on the drivers inability to determine who, or what, is
	actually in control of the automobile during critical situations.},

	and actions that have concurrent and dynamic properties. Based on
	it, we present a concurrent dynamic
	
	logic of knowledge, belief and certainty for MAS, which is called
	CDKBC logic. Furthermore, a CDKBC
	
	model is given for interpreting this logic. We construct a CDKBC proof
	system for the logic and show that
	
	the proof system is sound and complete, and prove that the validity
	problem for the system is EXPTIMEcomplete.},

abstract={A current survey of the emerging field of networked control systems is provided. The aim is to introduce the fundamental issues involved in designing successful networked control systems, to provide a snapshot assessment of the current state of research in the field, to suggest useful future research directions, and to provide a broad perspective on recent fundamental results. Reflecting the goals of the Special Issue itself, this paper surveys relevant work from the areas of systems and control, signal processing, detection and estimation, data fusion, and distributed systems. We discuss appropriate network architectures, topics such as coding for robustly stable control in the presence of time-varying channel capacity, channels with fixed versus adaptively variable data width, issues in data rate problems in nonlinear feedback problems, and problems in routing for stability and performance. In surveying current research on networked control systems, we find that recent theoretical advances and target applications are intimately intertwined. The common goal of papers in the Special Issue which follows is to describe key aspects of this relationship. We also aim to provide a bridge between networked control systems and closely related contemporary work dealing with sensor networks and wireless communication protocols},
