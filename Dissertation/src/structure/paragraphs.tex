% Configures: Paragraphs

% Options in this file influence how latex sets up paragraphs. These influence how many
% lines can be orphaned at the top or bottom of a page.

% \windowpenalty prevents the first line of a paragraph from being alone at the bottom of a page.
% It will either cause that line to move to the next page, or cause one line from the next page to join the lone line. 
\widowpenalty=10000
% \clubpenalty prevents the last line of a paragraph to be alone at the top of a page. At best it will force there to be two lines.
\clubpenalty=10000
