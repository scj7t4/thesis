New research about cyber-physical systems is rapidly changing the way we think about critical infrastructures like the power grid.
Changing requirements for generation, storage, economy, and availability are all driving the development of the smart-grid.
Many smart-grid projects disperse generation across a wide area and control devices with a distributed system. 
However, in a distributed system, the state of the processes in that system is hard to determine.
By using information flow security models, our research reasons about process's beliefs of the system state in a distributed system.
Using our framework, we create Markov models of the expected behavior of a cyber controller for a smart-grid system using a communication network with omission faults.
Using the Markov models we designed, we were able to analyze the behavior of the distributed system during communication faults and extended existing congestion management concepts to create feedback systems to allow the cyber-physical system to react better to issues in the communication network.
