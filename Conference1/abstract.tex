\section{Abstract}

This work presents a new technique for protecting a cyber-physical, real-time, distributed system during network congestion. 
New applications of existing congestion avoidance and detection methods are used to ensure that the system can still perform useful work, without causing physical instability, during network congestion.
By notifying processes of congestion, the process adjusts its behavior to continue to effectively manage power resources during the network congestion.
We demonstrate with these techniques that the availability of the distributed system is improved through various scenarios.
