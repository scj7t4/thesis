\section{Abstract}

This work presents a new application of congestion avoidance to provide increased availability for a real-time distributed system.
We present an approach to notify a process running distributed power management software for a smart-grid system of network congestion.
These notifications allow the process to adjust its behavior to allow the process to continue to manage power resources during the network congestion.
As a part of this work, we consider both the potential to perform meaningful work managing power resources, as well as the potential for attempted work to fail due to omission failure.
Several techniques are provided to allow the distributed system to harden itself against the network congestion and minimize the negative impacts.
We demonstrate with these techniques that the availability of the distributed system is improved through various scenarios.
