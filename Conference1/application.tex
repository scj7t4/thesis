% APPLICATION
% - Usage Theory
%       - Instead of dropping packets, the network device with RED will send messages to an application announcing congestion
%       - These announcements allow the CPS to adjust its behavior to allow better operation during the network fault.
%       - Network layout and design
%       - What are the goals of the successful operation of the CPS algorithm
%       - Balance the amount of K that accumlates, while maximizing the amount of work done.
%       - Describe the type of traffic we are accounting for
% - What happens on the receipt of a Soft ECN Message & Motivate this approach
% - What happens on the receipt of a hard ECN message & Motivate this approach
% - Justify why these approaches are good for the CPS.
% - Make sure there's mathy stuff about why this is better.
% - Justification using the models developed in the last paper--
%   - The congestion would normally cause RED to drop packets at a certain rate, we're entering a contract with the router to change behavior rather than having an omission rate.
% - Tune RED parameters based on Journal paper?
