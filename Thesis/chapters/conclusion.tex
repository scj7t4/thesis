\chapter{Conclusion}

This work presented a new approach for predicting the behavior of a real-time
distributed system under omission failure conditions. By using a continuous time
Markov chain, a variety of insights can be gathered about the system, including
observations such as how long a particular configuration will be stable for,
and the behavior of the system in the long run.  The Markov results will be used
 to make better real time schedules to better react to the network faults we
plan on introducing to our testbeds. For example, if migrations are failing
and a sufficient number of migrations can cause the physical system to fail,
the scheduler may need to behave in a manner that limits the number of failed
migrations that can occur before group reconfigures. This work is a stepping
stone towards designing a real-time schedule that manages the system correctly
when there are cyber faults. Schedules and behavior can be designed around how
the system behaves on its worst days. This work also allows these schedule designs
and evaluations to be completed much more quickly than they could be by running
the system for long periods of time. Therefore results from the test bed, combined
with results the models yield schedules that improve the stability of the
system during cyber faults.


The DGI group management system was first run with a testing framework that organized various configurations as prescribed by a series of input files and commands. The collected results provided insight into the interactions of the system as the omission failures increased.

However in environments where there are fewer omission failures, there were not a large enough number of events collected to make a satisfactory conclusion about the inter-arrival time about events at those levels of omission failures. In correct this we developed a simulation tool that recreates the events of the full DGI system in controlled circumstances. These collected events were used to construct a Markov chain that relates to the collected experimental results. These chains were fed into SharpE to produce an in group time metric equivalent to those collected using the experimental platform.

The simulator will allow the construction of larger models more quickly and will lead to increasingly refined methods of gauging the amount of time in group. This information can then been combined with the instability metrics collected from a physical system to rigorously determine the relationship between omission failures and the interaction between processes in controlling the physical system in order to prevent the number of omission failures from causing physical instability in the system.


It is important that the behavior of the cyber controller only supplements its physical component. If the behavior of the cyber component can potentially cause instability by making changes that do not benefit the physical system, particularly in cases where a system without a cyber component would have remained stable without interaction.

The primary concern are scenarios in which the cyber controller attempts to make physical components which are not connected in the physical network interact, and scenarios where a fault in the cyber network causes the paired events (where two physical controllers change to accomplish some transaction or exchange) to only be partially executed. For example, in the DGI load balancing scheme, a node in a supply state injects a quantum of power into the physical network, but the node in the demand state does not change to accept it. These errors, which is the primary focus of this work could cause instability if a sufficient number of these failed exchanges occur.

In \cite{HARINI}, Cloudhari et. al. show that failed transactions can create a scenario where the frequency of a power system could become unstable. They classified the stability of the system using a k-value which is a measure of the number of migrations which can fail before the system becomes unstable. As part of this the have created a series of invariants which a system must meet to be considered stable and remain stable. Given this, a metric of what the physical system can bear before becoming unstable, it is possible to tune the cyber control to limit the number of failed migrations by managing the membership of groups.


In a round-robin real-time schedule, each module gets a fixed amount of time to execute. As a consequence there is a fixed number of migrations a load balancing module can execute before the system re-evaluates the group's stability. Thus, a node which is failing to migrate due to lost messages can be handled correctly. It may be that the correct method is to remove from the group, change algorithms or adjust parameters. The correct action to take in the event of cyber failure in order to prevent physical failure is a topic of future research.

The rate that the system should reconfigure then is a function of the maximum number of failed migrations that the system can take, the time it takes to write to the channel and the time it takes process messages. The amount of time in group can also be consideration for which algorithm to select based on the needed amount of time to perform its work.

Group Management can be used as a critical component in a real-time distributed system to manage the number of lost messages, and as a consequence the number of failed migrations in a CPS. It is critical to understand how frequently nodes enter and exit the group based on lost messages and how many migrations fail as a consequence of those messages.

As a component of this work, the physical network will be examined. Using power simulations using PSCAD and the RTDS located at Florida State University, various models will be tested for physical stability while being subjected to packet loss.

The work presented in this document extends the work presented in \cite{CRITIS2012} and will be presented as journal paper. Adding analysis by causing physical instability will be a novel analysis for smart grid projects and CPSes in general. Future work should yield at least an additional journal paper and conference paper.
