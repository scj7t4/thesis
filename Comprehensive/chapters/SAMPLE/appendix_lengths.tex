\hline Symbol & Name & Description \\ \hline
$\lambda$ & wavelength & Wavelength of incident light \\ 
$L$ &  system length & Length of waveguide along direction of propagation ($z$-axis) \\ 
$W$ & system width & Dimension of waveguide perpendicular to direction of propagation ($y$-axis) \\
$L_{\phi}$ & phase coherence length & Length over which phase remains coherent. Equivalent to $L_{inelastic}$\cite{1988_Stone,1986_Imry}. Applicable only to electron transport. \\
$L_D$ & path length & How far a particle (i.e. ray optics) travels in the media in ballistic and diffusive regimes \\
$\ell_{scat}$ & scattering length & Average distance between scattering events. Often referred to as $\ell_{mfp}$ (mean free path) or the inelastic length\cite{1984_John_prl}, or extinction length\cite{1999_van_Tiggelen}. \\ 
$\ell_{tmfp}$ & transport mean free path & Average distance over which phase and direction are randomized.  $\ell_{tmfp} = \frac{\ell_{scat}}{1-\langle cos\ \theta \rangle}$. Sometimes referred to as elastic mfp\cite{1991_John}. % page 34, col 2
Measured with respect to $L$. \\ 
$\xi$ & localization length & Probability of diffusive path forming loop is 1. $\xi~=~N~\ell_{tmfp}$. Measured with respect to $L$. \\ 
$\ell_{a,g}$ & ballistic absorption/gain length & Average distance over which intensity decreases by two/increases by two. \\
$\xi_{a,g}$ & absorption/gain length & How far, on average, a particle travels in the diffusive regime before being absorbed (or doubled), measured with respect to path length $L_D$ in the diffusive regime \\ 
$z_p$ & penetration depth & Applies to diffusive regime only. $z_p \approx \ell_{tmfp}$ \\
