\section{Abstract}

This work presents an approach for modeling an election algorithm with omission failures using Markov chains.
To accomplish this a modified version of the ``Invitation Election Algorithm'' by Garcia-Molina was created.
The algorithm was executed in the environment of a smart-grid energy management system.
In this modified algorithm, the observations of a pre-selected process' group size were memoryless.
By taking advantage of this memorylessness an accurate closed form representation of the behavior of the algorithm was captured.
This model allowed the analysis of the system's steady-state probabilities.
These values were used to measure how much work the the smart-grid system could do while experiencing failure.
Results can be coupled with networking technologies like explicit congestion notification (ECN).
As a result, this method for autonomously configuring resources can anticipate failure and preemptively select the best configuration for issues that are about to arise.
