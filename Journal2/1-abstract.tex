\section{Abstract}

This work presents an approach for modeling an election algorithm with omission failures using Markov chains.
To accomplish this a modified version of the ``Invitation Election Algorithm'' by Garcia-Molina was created.
The algorithm was executed in the environment of a smart-grid energy management system.
In this modified algorithm, the observations of a pre-selected process' group size were memoryless.
By taking advantage of this memorylessness an accurate closed form representation of the behavior of the algorithm was captured.
This model allowed the analysis of the system's steady-state probabilities.
These values were used to measure how much work the the smart-grid system could do while experiencing failure.
The values also allowed for analysis that could be used to select new real-time schedules to compensate for message loss.
