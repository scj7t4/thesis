This work presents an approach for modeling a leader election algorithm used in a smart-grid project when messages are lost in transit.
Normally, non-deterministic behavior and race conditions make modeling distributed algorithms difficult.
However, we created a modified version of a popular leader election algorithm with special properties.
These special properties allow the algorithm to be modeled using a Markov chain.
The transitions of this chain are a closed-form description of the system's behavior.
Therefore, the design of the chain can be extended to any number processes.
As a result, this work presents a novel new consideration for the design of distributed algorithms.
The analysis of the generated chains describes predictive long-term behavior of the algorithm during omission failure.
