\section{Conclusion}

In this work we presented a new approach to modeling the behavior of a distributed algorithm.
By modifying the algorithm so the observations of a process are memoryless, the system can be modeled as Markov chain.
While these changes do limit the capabilities of the algorithm, they do establish a new approach to designing distributed algorithms.
These models accurately represent the behavior of the algorithm during omission failures.
Steady-state analysis of these models yields predictions for how much time a group can spend working.
This measured "In Group Time" can be used to adjust the schedule of a real-time system using the algorithm to ensure it can continue to do work.
Using this adjusting schedule approach the robustness of a cyber-physical system can be enhanced.
