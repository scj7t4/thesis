\section{Profile Chain Applications}

The profile chain can be used to ensure the FREEDM smart-grid is able to continue operating despite network issues.
The profile chain can be combined with different message sending strategies to maintain service.
For example, the DGI can change to a slower mode of operation to ensure operation continues normally despite connectivity issues.
By selecting different strategies depending on the message delivery probability the DGI can offer high performance in good network conditions and an acceptable level of service during faults.

The DGI focuses on managing power resources in a microgrid environment.
Resources can only be managed effectively when multiple DGI coordinate together to manage those resources.
Without another DGI to coordinate with, the DGI has a limited range of options to manage power generation, storage and loads.
Therefore, the amount of time DGI will spend coordinating with another process is of particular interest.
\cite{CRITIS2012} defines an ``In Group Time'' (IGT) metric to measure the amount of time a DGI process spends coordinating with at least one other process.
In this work, we define IGT based on the steady state of the profile chain.
Let $\pi=Steady(P)$ for some profile chain.
The IGT is the sum of all states in $\pi$, save the first state where the process is alone:

\[ IGT = \sum_{i=2}^{m} \pi_i \]

The steady state distributions are presented in Figures \ref{fig:3process}, \ref{fig:4process}, \ref{fig:5process} and \ref{fig:6process} show the steady state distribution for the configurations where the process is not alone.
The size of the complete stack indicates the IGT, while the components of each stack represent the probability of observing a specific configuration.
