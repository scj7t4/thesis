\section{Goodness of Fit Test}

To verify the test chain $T$ is equivalent to the profile chain $P$, a $\Chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test is employed.
The null-hypothesis of this test ($H_{0)$) asserts that the profile chain $P$ is equivalent to the test chain $T$:

\[ H_{0}: T = P \]

With an alternative hypothesis that the two chains are not equivalent:

\[ H_{1}: T \neq P \]

The $\Chi^2$ test measures the goodness of fit for a complete chain by combining the measurements of goodness of fit for the transitions away from each state.
Therefore, the goodness of fit test for the chain is a summation of tests for each state:

\[ \Chi^2 \sum_{i}^{m} \sum_{j}^{m} = \frac{n_{i}(P_{ij}-T_{ij})^2}{P_{ij}} \]

Where $n_{i}$ is the number of times the state $i$ was observed in the input sequence used to construct the test chain $T$.
The summation is distributed as $\Chi^2$ with $m(m-1)$ degrees of freedom if all entries in $P_{ij}$ are non-zero.
In this work, the profile Markov chain $P$ is always complete when $0<p<1.0$.
This property implies all probabilites in $P$ are non-zero, although the probability of that transition may be extremely small.
